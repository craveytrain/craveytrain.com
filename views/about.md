Hi, my name is Mike Cravey and I am a geek. I love technology. I believe in standards. I believe in doing things the right way.

I believe in the importance of strong social skills. I still shake hands with a firm grip and look people in the eye during a conversation.

I like to think I am a good engineer/developer/whatever we are calling ourselves these days. I still delude myself into believing we should strive for some semblance of privacy on the web. I love the idea of location-aware services and they simultaneously scare me.

I love to learn, about anything. I get a little proud sometimes and need to get knocked off my tree stump occasionally. I am obviously starved for content.
