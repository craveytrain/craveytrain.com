As you may or may not know, I work for [Gerson Lehrman Group](http://www.glgroup.com/) as a UI Engineer. While this is more of my professional site, I don't talk a lot about my work. Truth is, I really dig it here. I work with some fantastic fellow UI Engineers: [Garann Means](http://www.garann.com/), [Zubin Tiku](http://blog.rubikzube.com/) and [Chris Bosco](http://cbsides.com/blog) (and some others but I don't know their blog URLs, hint, hint).

As you can imagine, we are all big advocates of open source and have been looking for a way to give back to the community at large. So, we started a [GLGUI Toolbox](http://github.com/glgui/toolbox) repo on Github. So far, it's pretty remedial stuff on it but we hope to start putting out some of our more interesting work in the near future.

Check it out occasionally, [watch it](http://github.com/glgui/toolbox/toggle_watch), let us know of any [issues](http://github.com/glgui/toolbox/issues) you find with it or just give us [feedback](http://github.com/inbox/new/glgui) if you think it's useful (or not).
