While this site has cycled it's tech stack a few times, it's always been built on the hard work of the open source community. While it's entirety is available on [github](http://github.com/craveytrain/craveytrain.com), I would like to recognize the tools I am using now, as well as others I have used through the years, to build this site.

## Version 5 (current)
### 2012 - current

This is the current version of the site and represents a lot of the go-tos in my current toolkit. I have tried several different static site generators, starting off with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), tried out [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a bunch of aborted attempts of rolling my own, and eventually have settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Here's my current set of tools:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): Go-based static site generator.
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): Quite reasonably-priced cloud hosting
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): Package manager extraordinaire
- [Postcss](http://postcss.org/): Trying out a little alternative to Sass, Less, & Stylus these days
  - [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/): Trying to learn the new and emerging syntaxes
  - [cssnano](http://cssnano.co/): Appears to be latest and greatest css compressor
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/): DNS and performance tuning of the site.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): I moved from Sublime to Atom after Sublime 3 was in beta longer than it's plugins and just became frustrating.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac): Great GUI for batch lossless compression of various image formats.
- [ImageAlpha](https://pngmini.com/): Still one of the best lossy PNG compressors that does PNG8+alpha transparency.
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): While I often just go `NPM scripts`, this is handy for the metadata it uses about files. Plus, the plugin community is strong (and it's a lot faster than Grunt).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): This tool has changed how I work and allows me to be productive no matter where I am.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerization has really simplified how I deploy and portability of my site.
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/): Linting protects and style checking makes my code conform to standards.
- [JSBeautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify): I like my code looking consistent.
- *SVG*: From [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to [svgstore](https://github.com/w0rm/gulp-svgstore), vector graphics have really crispened up my site.


## Version 4
### 2009 - 2012
This is where this site gets a bit more relevant. I rebuilt this site several times and went from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) (self hosted) -> Tumblr -> [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) (hosted) -> [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) -> [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) -> [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) ([express](http://expressjs.com/)). I believed I needed a big, powerful site to host all of my dynamic content. Hindsight is truly 20/20.

## Version 3
### 2005 - 2009
Aaahh, the discovery of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/). The main topics here were more focused on food recipes and slow pitch softball. The one post that is preserved from this era is the [Bidet](/posts/bidet) post. Still my most popular post, ever.

## Version 2
### 2003 - 2005
[Movable Type](https://movabletype.org/). Aaahh... that was fun. I launched craveytrain.com in this time. I have some, terrible, terrible blog posts that are not worth preserving, hence they are not here. This was before I was fully aware how long things would be on the internet.

## Version 1
### 2001 - 2003
This was just built on blogger. I recall almost nothing about this site and there is, thankfully, no content available from it. This actually predates the domain.
