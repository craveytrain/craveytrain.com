Hi, my name is Mike Cravey and I'm a father, husband, and geek in Lake Jackson, TX. I'm also a Principal Web Developer at [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com) and when I'm not trying to make your travel experience great, I like to tinker with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles) and find new tools and processes, such as this site.
