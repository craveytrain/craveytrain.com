# Diagonal Sprites

Facinating concept. Considering a sprite file at work has about 50px in between each icon, I can see the value. However, one of the issues we are seeing is left vs right aligned icons. That diagonal works great for icons at the top of their container and aligned to the left side. If your design meets those astringent requirements, it seems like a really handy way to assure sprites don't overlap. However, if not, it may not buy you much.
