## Projects

### [Chores][]

I'm currently working on a chores app for my family. This gives me a chance to get a little more hands-on practice with a few of the more popular technologies: React, Redux, Websockets, and Webpack and hone development methodologies like TDD, immutable data, and pure functions.

### [Dotfiles][]

Constantly tinkering with command line tools to help my workflow just give me a chance to geek out.

### [Howittisms][]

Built to respectfully mock my boss and mentor by randomly spouting his quotes and playing with responsively resizing full bleed images and speechSynthesis in DOM Scripting.
