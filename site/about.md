I'm a Principal UX Engineer at [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com) and when I'm not trying to make your travel experience better, I like to tinker with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles), try out new tools and sometimes I even build things.

I've recently started teaching computer science as a high school elective and as a STEM course to 6th graders. Teaching can be a lot of fun.

After spending years in Austin and a year abroad (ask me about my time in London), my family and I now live back in small town Texas where my wife and I grew up. You can usually find me scouting out decent coffee or food.

If you are interested in the tech used to build this site, check out the [Colophon](/colophon/). If you are interested in the tools I like to use, check out the [uses](/uses/) page.
