Hey y'all, my name is Mike Cravey and I'm a father, husband, and geek in Lake Jackson, TX. I'm also a Principal UX Engineer at [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com) and when I'm not trying to make your travel experience better, I like to tinker with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles) and find new tools and processes.

I've recently started teaching an [Introduction to Web Development](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Syllabus--ANjBXim08UxL4UwYAjpJKMFpAQ-FuWeqNl5Upm3WqD5dfXmg) to a couple of middle school classes. Our first project is building a [recipe web page](https://codepen.io/craveytrain/pen/xaeXBm).

After spending years in Austin and a year abroad (ask me about my time in London), my family and I now live back in small town Texas where my wife and I grew up. You can usually find me scouting out decent coffee or food.

If you are interested in the tech used to build this site, check out the [Colophon](/colophon/). If you are interested in the tools I like to use, check out the [uses](/uses/) page.
