I'm a UX Engineer currently looking for my next opportunity. I like to tinker with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles), try out new tools and sometimes I even build things.

After spending years in Austin and a year abroad (ask me about my time in London), my family and I now live back in small town Texas where my wife and I grew up. You can usually find me scouting out decent coffee or food.

If you are interested in the tech used to build this site, check out the [Colophon](/colophon/). If you are interested in the tools I like to use, check out the [uses](/uses/) page.
