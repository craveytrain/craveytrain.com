## Version 8

### 2019 - 2022

This release was about trying a new platform. I've heard lots of good things about Svelte, so I am giving it a try. Some of the tooling that isn't specific to this site has been moved over to the [uses](/uses) page.

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the UI framework
- [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) is used to statically generate the site
- Continue to host on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) cause it's awesome
- Markdown parsing is done by [Remark](https://remark.js.org), passed to [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype), and plumbed together by [Unified](https://unifiedjs.com).
