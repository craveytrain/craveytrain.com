So, a quick note letting you know (in case you couldn't tell) I moved the blog back to Wordpress. I tried out Tumblr because it is very convenient and simple. I wanted something with less upkeep. But the lack of flexibility really started to bother me. It's a great blogging system, but as it turns out, I wanted more features. So, I'm back to WordPress. That is all.
