## Version 5

### 2012 - 2016

I have tried several different static site generators, starting off with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), tried out [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a bunch of aborted attempts of rolling my own, and eventually have settled on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Here's my current set of tools:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): Go-based static site generator.
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): Quite reasonably-priced cloud hosting
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): Package manager extraordinaire
- [Postcss](http://postcss.org/): Trying out a little alternative to Sass, Less, & Stylus these days
  - [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/): Trying to learn the new and emerging syntaxes
  - [cssnano](http://cssnano.co/): Appears to be latest and greatest css compressor
- [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/): DNS and performance tuning of the site.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): I moved from Sublime to Atom after Sublime 3 was in beta longer than it's plugins and just became frustrating.
- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac): Great GUI for batch lossless compression of various image formats.
- [ImageAlpha](https://pngmini.com/): Still one of the best lossy PNG compressors that does PNG8+alpha transparency.
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): While I often just go `NPM scripts`, this is handy for the metadata it uses about files. Plus, the plugin community is strong (and it's a lot faster than Grunt).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): This tool has changed how I work and allows me to be productive no matter where I am.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerization has really simplified how I deploy and portability of my site.
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/): Linting protects and style checking makes my code conform to standards.
- [JSBeautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify): I like my code looking consistent.
- _SVG_: From [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to [svgstore](https://github.com/w0rm/gulp-svgstore), vector graphics have really crispened up my site.
