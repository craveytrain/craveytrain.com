description: Blow drying a wet stovetop to stop the ignitors from firing — thank you, internet.

I would have never guessed I would be blow drying my range out this evening. The cleaning lady came today and while she does a fantastic job, apparently she got the cooktop too wet. When electronic ignitor switches get too wet, they just start igniting. No gas leak, nothing else wrong other than the ignitors were firing. Turns out a little blow dry session dries them all out and it's right as rain.

The thing is, I found this out by Googling for it. I even talked to my dad who is my go to person when I need to know how to fix something and he had never heard of it. I just wonder what would have happened had I not had the internet to figure this out. I suppose I would have paid way too much for a technician to come out and be victim to his or her whim.

Long live the internet!
