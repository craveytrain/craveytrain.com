## Version 4

### 2009 - 2012

This is where this site gets a bit more relevant. I rebuilt this site several times and went from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) (self hosted) -> Tumblr -> [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) (hosted) -> [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) -> [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) -> [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) ([express](http://expressjs.com/)). I believed I needed a big, powerful site to host all of my dynamic content. Hindsight is truly 20/20.
