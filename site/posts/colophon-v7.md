## Version 7

### 2018 - 2020

I decided home grown static site generators are a pain, so I switched gears and went with Gatsby. This is also the first version in a while where I got out of the business of operations work for the site. I'm now using Netlify (after an aborted attempt to get it working in serverless fashion with AWS Lambdas and S3).

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/): This seems an interesting tool, that handles a lot of the PWA boilerplate. That seems like a useful framework to have mastery over.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Free hosting (for my size site, it's just simpler, does PR previews, auto publishing based on github master branch, all the things)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): Package manager extraordinaire (now v6)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): Still enjoying atom and while I'm using all the usual culprits for plugins, a couple are worth mentioning that may be off the beaten path
  - [Dark Mode](https://atom.io/packages/dark-mode): This may be my favorite one right now. It toggle between 2 themes based on ambient light detected by the onboard light sensor on my computer. As I tend to swap working inside and outside a fair bit, this is great for selecting a dark theme for indoors (solarized dark), and a bright theme for outdoors (solarized light);
  - [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons): Cause I like pretty pictures
  - [Autocomplete for modules](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-modules): Having my IDE give me the relative path is a great way to make sure I'm never referencing a package that does not exist
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): This tool has changed how I work and allows me to be productive no matter where I am.
- [Github](https://git-scm.com/): This tool has changed how I work and allows me to be productive no matter where I am.
- [Docker](https://github.com): Containerization has really simplified how I deploy and portability of my site.
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/): Linting protects and style checking makes my code conform to standards.
- [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/): Config sharing tool to normalize code style across IDEs and users.
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/): CSS linter and fixer
- [PrismJS](http://prismjs.com/): Lightweight syntax highlighter
- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized): I use light and dark for terminal and IDE.
