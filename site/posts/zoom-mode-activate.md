It all started with the admirable goal of being a little more illuminated when I Zoom. To not look like I live under the mountain, in constant search of my precious. What ensued feels like a [Rube Goldberg]-eque solution to what is essentially, turn on the lights. While I don't feel like I have the best solution, I didn't find an obvious better solution, either.

## Context

I work from home and all of my work interactions are virtual. I recently rearranged my portion of our home office, for reasons unrelated work, and I now face a nice big window. However, that window is across the room and I have a large monitor between myself and the window. Those 2 properties lead to a pretty significant shadow on my face while I am at my computer. It's not a problem when I'm working, but when I'm on a call, I'd like to be seen in a bit better light.

I tried simply turning on the overhead lights in the room, however, they are brighter than I would care to have on all the time and, as it turns out, due to their position, they don't actually illuminate my face very well. They just make for a glare off my bald head and a more ominous looking beard. Sure, that's great for role-playing a marauding dwarf in DnD, but it's not the consistent look I'm going for.

# Evaluating solutions

Initially, I thought, I can solve this problem with money, and sure, there are plenty of ways I can spend my way out of this problem. However, I was hoping to not have to spend much to get my solution
