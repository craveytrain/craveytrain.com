## Version 9

### 2023 - Current

Turns out, as much I enjoy building apps with Svelte, it's just really hard to beat straight HTML and CSS for a website. So, I moved it to 11ty and I've tried to spend some time deprogramming some of my learned habits from building with frameworks. it's been a lot of fun.

- [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev) is the Static Site Generator (SSG)
