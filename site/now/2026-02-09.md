## Work

### UX Engineering

I'm looking for my next opportunity—something that bridges design and engineering, where I can contribute across the full spectrum of making things on the web.

If you're building something thoughtful and need that perspective, [let's talk](http://www.linkedin.com/in/craveytrain).

## Building

### This Site, Always

Currently updating this site to have this brand-spanking new now page. Also shipping a new design here shortly.

### Side project app

Aside from updating this website, I'm finally taking the time to build an app I've had on my mind for a long time. I'm not quite ready to talk about it yet, but I will as soon as I get something shipped.

## Learning

Continuing to drink from the fire hose that is AI. Sometimes I barely have time to try out a framework or tool before learning about a new one. It can cause a bit of whiplash.

## Reading

While I'm a little late to the party, I'm currently reading _The Eye of the World_, the first book in the Wheel of Time series. I've already watched the show, but I'm really enjoying the book.

## Life

Coming off coaching JH basketball season, I've been focusing on getting to the gym regularly and continuing my weight loss journey.
