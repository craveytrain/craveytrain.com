Here's a current snapshot of the tools I use.

## Terminal

- One of my favorite projects, I am constantly tinkering with my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles).
- While I've tried Hyper a few times, and love the idea of it, I continue to use [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com) for it's stability and speed.
- I use [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) for my terminal as well.

## Editor

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my editor of choice after years of Atom and Sublime Text before that. Some of my fav extensions/themes are:
  - [Better Comments](https://github.com/aaron-bond/better-comments) highlights lines based on the type of comment.
  - [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2) helps disambiguate the flying V of closing braces by coloring them to match their corresponding opening brackets.
  - [File Icons](https://github.com/file-icons/vscode) helps provide some visual recognition to file types.
  - [Import Cost](https://github.com/wix/import-cost) displays the estimated size of the imported packages.
  - [Settings Sync](https://github.com/shanalikhan/code-settings-sync) syncs settings, extensions, themes and more across multiple computers.
  - [Shades of Purple](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode) puts my favorite color into daily practice.
  - [Wrap Console Log](https://github.com/midnightsyntax/vscode-wrap-console-log) wraps variables into console log, cause despite my desire to utilize debugging, I still reach for `console.log` first.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) handles all my formatting needs.
- It took quite a while for me to come around to it, but I'm on board with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) now handles TS linting and Prettier integration.
- [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) is my current fav mix of mono-spaced, ligaturized, font for all my dev uses.

## OS & Apps

- I use [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) for both work and personal.
- [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com) handles my snippets and clipboard history (along with other goodness) and some of my favorite workflows are:
  - [Colors](https://github.com/TylerEich/Alfred-Extras/blob/master/Workflows/Colors.alfredworkflow) is useful for converting colors between formats (e.g., HSL, RGBA, Hex).
  - [Coolers](https://github.com/radibit/alfred-coolors) suggests color names based on the value.
