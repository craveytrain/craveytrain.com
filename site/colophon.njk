<p>While this site has cycled it's tech stack a few times, it's always been built on the hard work of the open source community. While it's entirety is available on [github](http://github.com/craveytrain/craveytrain.com), I would like to recognize the tools I am using now, as well as others I have used through the years, to build this site.<p>
