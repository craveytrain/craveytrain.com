# Craveytrain.com blog

This is the software that runs craveytrain.com. It's nothing special, just really a pet project more than anything. Please feel free to dig around, take what ya like, etc. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, etc, please feel free to use the appropriate mechanisms here on github. Thanks.

## TODO
- Use a jade template for gists to get more meta information in, making it closer to the original gist format.

- Get GZIP compression in. Not sure if that means using the connect-gzip module, moving the static server over to nginx or what.

- Stylus/SASS/LESS. I really need to learn one of these. How do I have a build process for dev that renders it on the fly but for prod is precompiled? Git hook for push to production?
