# Milestone v9.1: Content Restructure

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-09
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

Content restructure for craveytrain.com: now page system with archives, consolidated colophon from 9 blog posts, and uses page in navigation. Each phase delivered one independent feature using existing site styles. Quick depth prioritized delivery — each phase was a complete, shippable feature.

## Phases

**Goal:** Users can view current now page and browse dated archive of previous updates
**Depends on:** None (first phase, uses existing layouts)
**Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Foundation and content (now directory, layout, first now page with navigation)
- [x] 01-02: Archive system (archive listing, previous/next navigation)
- [x] 01-03: Gap closure (fix nav location, nav styling, title escaping)

**Requirements covered:**

- NOW-01: Now page displays its last-updated date from frontmatter
- NOW-02: Now page has 3-5 focus area sections (e.g., Work, Learning, Life)
- NOW-03: Now page includes link to nownownow.com explanation
- NOW-04: Latest now content appears at `/now/` (auto-generated index)
- NOW-05: Each now update gets dated archive at `/now/<date>.html`
- NOW-06: Archive listing exists at `/now/archive/` with all dated versions
- NOW-07: Now pages link to previous version for navigation

**Requirements covered:**

- COL-01: Colophon exists as single page at `/colophon/`

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Date       | Decision                               | Rationale                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-02-06 | 3-phase structure for quick depth      | 13 requirements cluster naturally into 3 independent features |
| 2026-02-06 | Content before design                  | Avoid expensive rework from design-first approach             |
| 2026-02-07 | Footer navigation via 'foot' tag       | Site uses footer-only navigation pattern (not header)         |
| 2026-02-07 | override:tags for collection isolation | Prevents data cascade tag merging                             |

| 2026-02-09 | Uses page order 1 in footer nav        | Places Uses after Now (order 0) in footer navigation          |

**Issues Resolved:**

- Double HTML escaping in page titles
- Archive page appearing in its own collection listing

**Issues Deferred:**

- COL-05: Redirects from old colophon blog post URLs (user decided not needed)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
