## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- CSS wholesale replacement (not incremental migration)
- Self-hosted fonts (Fraunces + Inter, WOFF2)
- Variable font files for fewer HTTP requests
- Page-specific CSS via frontmatter variable
- splitBySections filter parses rendered HTML by H2 tags
- Static tag pages over JS filter (future enhancement)
- Mobile hero Option C (avatar inline, text-forward)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Double HTML entity encoding in section labels (fixed with | safe filter)
- Posts nav link active state on individual post pages (scoped to /posts/ only)

**Issues Deferred:**

- Dark mode toggle (ENH-03)
- Client-side tag filtering (ENH-01)
- View Transitions API (ENH-04)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Minor: tags.njk and tag-list.njk have inconsistent trailing slashes (functional, low priority)
