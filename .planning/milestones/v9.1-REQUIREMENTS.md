## Out of Scope

| Feature                    | Reason                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Visual redesign            | Separate project — content structure first |
| New templates              | Separate project — use existing layouts    |
| Dark mode                  | Future consideration                       |
| Now page location tracking | Design shows date only                     |
| Real-time now updates      | Defeats purpose — manual monthly/quarterly |
