Hey y'all, my name is Mike Cravey and I'm a father, husband, and geek in Lake Jackson, TX. I'm also a Principal UX Engineer at [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com) and when I'm not trying to make your travel experience better, I like to tinker with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/craveytrain/dotfiles) and find new tools and processes.
